The levels of circulating D-dimer, a fibrin degradation product after a blood clot is degraded by fibrinolysis, are significantly higher in AAV patients in active stage compared with those in remission [7]. However, the underlying mechanism of this hypercoagulable state in AAV is not yet fully clarified.","The level of circulating C-reactive protein (CRP) is elevated in active phase of AAV, and falls rapidly with remission of the disease [8]. Interestingly, Ma et al. recently found that AAV patients with elevated circulating D-dimer had more severe clinical manifestations and higher levels of circulating CRP compared to patients with normal circulating D-dimer. Moreover, correlation analysis showed that the levels of circulating D-dimer positively correlated with the levels of circulating CRP [7]. Circulating CRP belongs to the pentraxin family and contains 5 identical, noncovalently linked subunits (pentameric CRP, pCRP). Many studies have demonstrated that in cardiovascular disease, the circulating pCRP can dissociate into modified or monomeric CRP (mCRP) on activated platelets and accelerate thrombogenesis [9-12]. Compared with cardiovascular disease, the circulating pCRP levels in active AAV are generally much higher, but its significance in VTEs of AAV had been less well studied.","In AAV, ANCA can induce the neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation after binding neutrophils. NETs are DNA fibers comprising histones, antimicrobial proteins and tissue factor [13-17]. Since some previous studies have reported that NETs can provide a scaffold for platelets adhesion and activation, it is reasonable to hypothesize that circulating pCRP can transform to mCRP on activated platelets by the aid of ANCA-induced netting neutrophils and the newly generated mCRP can accelerate thrombogenesis in AAV. On the other hand, cumulative evidences have proved a biologic association between thrombogenesis and inflammation. Elevated inflammation is both a cause and a result of thrombogenesis [18,19]. Thus, it is also reasonable to speculate that circulating CRP not only takes part in the process of thrombogenesis in AAV, but also enhances the subsequent inflammatory response following VTEs. High mobility group box 1 (HMGB-1) is an intracellular protein that can bind DNA and regulate gene expression. Besides, it can also function as a kind of proinflammatory mediator when released from cells [20]. Recently published studies have demonstrated that the activated platelets can secrete HMGB-1 [21,22].","In this study, we investigated whether ANCA-induced netting neutrophils could activate platelets and then prompt the formation of mCRP on activated platelets. We also investigated whether mCRP could further enhance the activation of platelets, the formation of D-dimer and the secretion of HMGB-1 of platelets."]},{"title":"Methods","subsections":[{"title":"Patients","paragraph":["Patients’ plasma was obtained from 5 AAV patients with positive myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA.

As an important component of NETs, histones have been reported to be able to activate platelets directly and promote thrombin generation [15-17]. In the current study, undigested netting neutrophils could not activate platelets, while DNase I-pretreated netting neutrophils increased the expression of CD62p of platelets significantly in static incubation system. This phenomenon suggests that histones which are masked by the DNA of intact NETs are necessary for the activation of platelets in static incubation system. Contrary to the results obtained in static incubation system, the integrity of DNA is the prerequisite of the platelets activation in perfusion experiments, because shearing force is one of the key factors for platelets activation and only the intact DNA can offer a barrier for retaining platelets from flowing blood [25-27].","Although we could not exclude the possibility that pCRP also bound activated pletelets with immunofluorescence assay, Western-Blot with 1/20 of standard SDS helped us to distinguish whether the CRP deposited on activated platelets was mCRP, pCRP or the mixture of both mCRP and pCRP. Through this method, we demonstrated that the deposited CRP was mCRP not pCRP because it ran as a single band without a smear. Although after perfusion experiments, there was still some pCRP which did not dissociate into mCRP, no smear at higher molecular weights was detected in Western-Bolt. The reason should be that slides had been rinsed with Hanks solution (containing Ca2+) and the pCRP which did not bind platelets was removed before Western-Bolt.","It was noteworthy that static co-incubation of isolated NETs and pCRP without platelets did not generate mCRP. So it was not the components of NETs that dissociate pCRP in perfusion experiments. The existence of activated platelets should be the prerequisite of the formation of mCRP. According to previous studies, lysophosphatidylcholine exposed on the cell membrane of activated platelets can offer a surface for the dissociation of pCRP [9]. On activation and adhesion, platelets undergo a rapid change in morphology and composition of membrane lipids, leading to the exposure of bioactive lipid and the dissociation of adhered pCRP to mCRP [9].","pCRP and mCRP differ in their biological effects. mCRP can exert various effects that are distinct from those of pCRP. Intravenous pCRP administration significantly enhanced leukocyte rolling, adhesion, and transmigration via localized dissociation to mCRP, while inhibiting the dissociation of pCRP diminished these effects [27]. Several studies have demonstrated the important effect of mCRP on the activation of coagulation system [10,12]. Similar to the results of previous studies, we found that the platelets could be activated by mCRP in static incubation system. mCRP could even enhance the activation of platelets induced by DNase I-pretreated netting neutrophils in static incubation system. We also found mCRP deposited on the activated platelets could enhance the activation of platelets and the formation of D-dimer in perfusion experiments. So the activation of platelets in perfusion experiments with pCRP-containing PRP should be induced by two factors: shearing force and the deposited mCRP. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to show a causal role of mCRP on the thrombosis in AAV.","Although the expression of tissue factor in NETs has been reported by previous studies [28], we did not find the formation of D-dimer after the static co-incubation of netting neutrophils and PRP or after the perfusion of netting neutrophils with PFP. On the other hand, although the static co-incubation of mCRP and PRP could activate platelets, it did not induce the formation of D-dimer. Interestingly, the existence of mCRP could enhance the formation of D-dimer when the immobilized ANCA-induced netting neutrophils were perfused with PRP. Therefore, we think both flow conditions and platelets are necessary for the activation of coagulation system induced by ANCA-induced netting neutrophils, and the existence of mCRP should accelerate this process.","More and more studies demonstrate that inflammation and thrombosis can influence each other [18,19]. On one hand, inflammation has been suggested as a risk factor for VTE, on the other hand, apparent systemic inflammatory responses can be found in the acute phase of deep vein thrombosis [18,19]. HMGB-1 is an intracellular protein and function as a kind of proinflammatory mediator in AAV when released from cells. The levels of HMGB-1 in active AAV patients are significantly higher than those in remission [29-32]. Incubation of neutrophils with HMGB-1 significantly increases the NETs formation of neutrophils in vitro [20]. Interestingly, Wang et al. found that plasma levels of HMGB-1 correlated with circulating CRP level in AAV [32]. In the current study, we found that the existence of mCRP enhanced the HMGB-1 secretion of platelets under flow conditions. This indicates mCRP might be a potential link between thrombosis and inflammation in AAV.","We did not find direct binding of pCRP or mCRP to the activated neutrophils in perfusion experiments. This seems to be in contrast to the current literature [33]. We think there might be some reasonable explanations for this phenomenon. First, the duration of perfusion experiments (10 min) was not long enough. Second, before perfusion experiments, neutrophils had been incubated with ANCA and the Fc receptors on neutrophils, which were also the potential receptors for pCRP and mCRP, had been occupied by ANCA. Third, the NETs surrounded the activated neutrophils and prevented the binding of pCRP or mCRP on the cell surface.","In the current study, we also did not find the direct binding between mCRP and the undigested NETs, while NETs pretreated by DNase I could be bound by mCRP. Although this phenomenon could be explained by the binding between MPO and mCRP, it was noteworthy that polyclonal rabbit anti-MPO antibodies could not inhibit the binding totally (the A 405 nm was decreased by only 26%). This phenomenon means there might be some other components in NETs which can bind mCRP. Actually, previous studies indicate that mCRP has lectin-like properties and can bind galactose-containing residues [34-36]. So one possible explanation might be that mCRP also binds some substances in NETs which are full of galactose. This hypothesis needs further investigation.","The current study provides a potential link between mCRP and VTEs in AAV. Therefore, elevated circulating pCRP not only is a biomarker of AAV, but also plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AAV. Although our experiments are done in vitro, it is reasonable to speculate that all these processes might also occur in vivo. First, ANCA has been proved to be an important NETs inducer and enhanced formation NETs has been reported in patients with AAV [13]. Immunostaining in kidney tissue of humans with AAV demonstrated the existence of NETs [14]. The direct proof of the participation of NETs in the thrombogenesis in AAV has been reported. In the study of Nakazawa et al., NETs were identified in the thrombus in an AAV patient with deep vein thrombosis. The authors also found that the amount of NETs in the thrombus was significantly greater in that patient when compared with other thrombi unrelated to AAV [37]. Second, NETs have been proved to be able to induce apoptosis of endothelial cells directly in vitro, so the NETs induced by ANCA might injure the endothelial cells and offer a surface for the activation of coagulation system in AAV [38]. Third, the existence of mCRP in AAV has been proved by the previous study, which found that mCRP was observed in the cytoplasm of tubules and interstitium of renal biopsies from nine out of the ten patients with AAV [39].","There are some limitations of this study. First, no immunostaining of mCRP in the thrombus of patients with AAV was done and our understanding of the pathophysiology of pCRP dissociation was based on in vitro findings. Second, although hypercoagulable state is associated with the disease activity of AAV, the significance of the VTEs in AAV still needs further elucidation. Previous studies indicated the patients who had a VTE event seemed to be older than patients without VTE, but no differences about the indexes of disease severity were found between two groups [5]. It is noteworthy that all previous studies do not include a prospective screening protocol for VTEs and investigators count only clinically apparent VTEs for incidence estimates [1-5]. So the real incidence of VTEs in AAV and the influences of VTEs on the disease severity of AAV need to be investigated in future."]},{"title":"Conclusions","paragraph":["In conclusion, ANCA-induced NETs can activate platelets and then prompt the formation of mCRP on activated platelets. Then the newly generated mCRP can further enhance the activation of platelets, the process of thrombogenesis, and the inflammatory response. So we think the increased circulating pCRP might be a potential therapy target in AAV and should be paid more attention."]}]},"citations":[{"reference":"  Etanercept plus standard therapy for
